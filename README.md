### IG_A1_V5_skin_vae_integrated_bayesian_SVM_deconvolver.ipynb
- Prototype notebook containing the rationale and workflow for a bayesian optimised, probabilistic support vector machine with bayesian posterior probabilities of correspondence computed using observations derived from iterative hypergeometric sampling of the training data, and probabilistic outputs from the SVM. Priors are weighted by the reciprocal of celltype availability per donor.


# Standard Project
A template repo for the standard RSE project

## About

Prenatal human skin morphogenesis is regulated by crosstalk between immune and non-immune cells.
Further details/abstract to be put here.

## Built With

This section is intended to list the frameworks and tools you're using to develop this software. Please link to the home page or documentatation in each case.

[Framework 1](https://something.com)  
[Framework 2](https://something.com)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Any tools or versions of languages needed to run code. For example specific Python or Node versions. Minimum hardware requirements also go here.

Folders contain scripts relating to analysis of single cell RNA-seq data and Visium spatial transcriptomic data. The scRNA-seq folder is split into scripts relating to data analysis (e.g. quality control and annotations) and to those producing the final figures in the manuscript. Scripts in the panel subdirectories produced both main and supplementary figures and are labelled based on type of analysis performed.

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
