### IG_A1_V5_skin_vae_integrated_bayesian_SVM_deconvolver.ipynb

- Prototype notebook containing the rationale and workflow for a bayesian optimised, probabilistic support vector machine with bayesian posterior probabilities of correspondence computed using observations derived from iterative hypergeometric sampling of the training data, and probabilistic outputs from the SVM. Priors are weighted by the reciprocal of celltype availability per donor.
